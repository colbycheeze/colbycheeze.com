# I am a challenge seeker and love writing code.
### My Past
I've dabbled in programming since I was a kid, and have always enjoyed creating things. I've always been a self learner, as I love picking up books and resources and just figuring things out. Overcoming challenges has always been a big rush for me.

For some years I picked up Flash as a way to express my creativity and quickly learned how to build games and apps. I was hired on with a freelance agency and given loads of time sensitive projects for high end customers including MTV, Toyota, and Kraft. I built many libraries and frameworks on the side to help my colleagues and improve our workflows for various projects.

### And then...
I took a break from programming for a while after my Youtube channel hit it really big. I've always had a passion for teaching, and it just so happened that I ended up making some really good videos that people wanted to see. At my peak, I was getting around 2.5 million views a month, but I realized that I wanted to change my focus back to coding.

### Most Recent
Now that I decided to switch focus, I have committed 100% to getting back into web development. I sold my gaming PC, and now sleep 5 hours a night in order to wake up and learn / build all day long. When I choose to focus on something, I jump in 100%. I've been studying Ruby on Rails + Javascript from as many of the most recommended courses and books as I can find.

### The Future
I want to build up a new following on my Youtube for programming screencasts, as well as revive my blog which I used to write very heavily for back when I used to code Flash games and apps. I am a huge people person and love to interact with the community, so writing and screen casting is an easy way for me to give back.

### What I am looking for
My goal is to join with a company who are Agile minded, and love pairing / mentoring. I aim to learn from people smarter than me and grow as fast as possible. I am a very strong proponent of best practices and doing things right, so I want a company that can emulate my beliefs.
