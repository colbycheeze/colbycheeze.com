I have always been really anal about improving my efficiency and
producvity at work. Getting things done, and not wasting any time is always at
the top of my mind. After years of trial and error, and many small tweaks, I feel that
I am close to reaching maximum productivity, and I'd like to share with you
how.

### Having a clear objective is key.
I don't know how many times I've
forgone  planning just to find myself wandering
aimlessly and wasting so much time. Planning is like [Test Driven Development][TDD] in that you spend a bit of
time up front to save yourself enormous amounts of time later.

![Wander

Planning doesn't have to be this massive event. Also, it is something you have
to practice to get good at. Just start by writing down 3-5 important things to
focus on. **Keyword**: ==FOCUS==. Be very specific, and try to keep the task as
small as possible. You should be able to complete it within 30 minutes to 2
hours. If it takes longer, you can probably break it down further.

> **Simple Example**: For my recent planning, I had an overall focus for the week of
> "complete minimum viewable experience for blog" which I completed two days ago.
> I did complete that focus, but I had also planned to get out several pieces of
> content as my next focus, therefore I spent a few minutes brainstorming 3
> articles I could write.
> 
> Now when I go to get started for the day, I see the topic I am to write about
> and there is no thinking involved (which is great for just waking up). I got on
> my computer, and went straight into writing.

### Unlock the power of MICRO habits and consistency
I believe many do not truly recognize how powerful habits can be in our lives.
It is a really amazing topic that you can spend hours reading into and
debating, but for our purposes I am here to tell you that if you can harness
just a fraction of the power that creating strong micro habits gives you, then
soon you will be unstoppable.

![Micro
Habits](http://i2.wp.com/yourmotivationguru.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/Success-is-the-sum-of-small-efforts-repeated-day-in-and-day-out.-R-Collier-e1418706081465.jpg)

In the past, I always had trouble making changes in my life because I am such a
big dreamer and almost always bite off more than I can chew. I'll be honest, I'm
pretty cocky. Sure this causes me to fall flat on my face quite often, but by stretching
myself I am always growing.

For now, I suggest opening [ this link ][1] in a new tab and getting yourself an
overview of micro habits. The idea here is to make it next to impossible to
fail. **For example**, if your goal is to do one pushup a day and you get sick with
the flu, you can still complete your goal.

One selling point I will give you here, is that by creating as MANY default
behaviors as possible, and removing any thinking involved with figuring out how
your day is going to go, you will de-stress by a huge amount. I can't tell you
how good of a feeling it is to think only about your main motivations
each day, instead of all of life's little details.

> The rest of the things I am going to talk about all tie into this major concept,
> so it is very important that you understand it. At the end of this article, I'll
> give you a breakdown of [ what my day looks like. ](#my-daily-routine)

### Sleep
I can't fucking stand sleep. I wish I was a
cyborg that didn't need rest. Perhaps a human in a terminator body. That would
be kickass. I've done hours and hours of research on how to reduce sleep, and
even tried [The Uberman Sleep Schedule.][uberman] For now, I sleep 4-5 hours a
night, because that works.

![Terminator](http://playeressence.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/terminator_00316662.jpg)

Many people cling to the idea that they need 8 hours of sleep, and tout just how
much they LOOOOOVE their sleep. This is completely unnecessary, but I won't get
into that debate. For now, [ check out this article ][sleep].

Rather than setting an alarm to wake up at, try setting a TIMER for exactly the
amount of time you would like to sleep. The trick is to discover the window of
time that your body is in REM sleep, and wake up during that time. If you don't
frequently wake from a dream, you need to adjust the amount of time backwards
(or maybe forwards if you are like me and sleep 4-5hrs)

### Food
In the same way that I hate sleep, having to constantly worry about food is a
big pain. For any repetitive task, I am always looking to optimize, and
preparing / eating food is no exception.

![Crock
Pot](http://hopebiblechurchonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Crockpot-Meal.jpg)

**I cook my meals for the entire week**, and have pre-planned meals ready to go.
Save for allowing myself to eat out with buddies as a reward, I don't concern
myself EVER with thinking, "Hmm, what am I going to eat?" 

Tell me, how many times during the day do you think about
food? Seriously, I can probably count about 5-10 times a day that I hear my
roommate call out, "I'm hungry." It is absurd how much brain power gets lost
thinking about food.

> Don't get too caught up in healthy eating if you aren't very familiar with the
> subject. Definitely set aside some time to learn, but for now ==include as many vegetables== as you can, and reduce as many "white" foods as you can **IE**.
> **Breads, pastas, rice, sugar, milk, etc.**

###### This can be expanded into multiple articles, so I'll leave you with a few tips.

  * Pre-plan 5-10 enjoyable recipes that you can easily buy and prepare each week.
  * Never concern yourself with deciding on what to eat. If you get bored, plan
    time to come up with new recipes, and then eat what you have in the meantime.
  * Create meals for the entire week. Crockpots and casseroles are your best
    friend. It is extremely easy to make tasty, healthy, lasting meals which can
be portioned into tupperware for the week.
  * Do some research on eating healthy. It will drastically improve your
    brain-power while working

### Exercise
Here is an area I could really improve on, but have done much better with
recently and am already seeing huge returns. At some point, no matter how
efficient you get with your processes, your brain-power is just going to fall
off.

I've found that so far, I can get in about 6-7 hours max of peak performance
pomodoro productivity. Anything after that and my ability to work strong is just
crushed, and I find that my brain is in a funk. The only way to get peak hours
into the day is to improve health and stamina.

Spending 20-60 minutes a day exercising will add WAY more time to your day than
working an extra couple of hours. There has been tons of research on the correlation
between brain function and exercise.

I'm actually __not a fan__ of spending multiple hours in the gym. It really isn't
necessary to get the benefits we are talking about here.. It is more important to get a moderate amount of
activity in THROUGHOUT the day, than just chunking the exercise all together in
the morning. You should be taking ==5-10 minute breaks at LEAST once an hour== to
get up and move around. If you are completely sedentary, this will change your life.

###### Here are some simple and easy exercises you can do during a 5-10 minute break.

  * Dance to some EDM music
  * Go for a quick run or brisk walk
  * Pushups
  * Pullups (would need a pullup bar)
  * Squats
  * Calf raises
  * Jumping Jacks
  * Do some stretches

### Eliminate ADD issues and distractions
So to tie everything together, with possibly the most important focus technique
for me, is using a "Get Things Done" strategy. Mine is the [ Pomodoro technique ][3].

![The Pomodoro
Technique](http://pomodorotechnique.com/wp-content/themes/pomodoro/img/logos/logo.png)

**I am extremely ADD**, and my mind tends to wander all over the place. I've tried
many systems for staying focused and nothing has ever worked for me until I
started doing Pomodoros.

My tool of choice is [KanbanFlow][]. This is a tool similar to Trello, but
it adds a timer to your tasks. The idea is that you work in 25 minute intervals,
and take 5 minute relax breaks in between. After 4 pomodoros you take a guilt free 15
minute break to do whatever you please.

> Not only does it help me to keep my mind fresh, and focus on not being
> distracted, it also is a nice history of what I did for the week which I can go
> back and review.

### My daily routine  
As promised, here is my daily routine outlined for you. There are a lot of
smaller things interwoven in here, but I wanted to give you an example in order
to see how serious I am.

  1. Wake up, turn on side lamp immediately, sit up, take a big deep breath
     and stretch out. This helps me ==not go back to sleep==, and I already start to
       feel awake as my body recognizes it's time to stop [drugging itself][2].
  2. Make cup of coffee (which is set up from night before), and do 20 squats,
     or pushups depending on the day.
  3. Now that my brain is primed, I sit at the computer and begin immediately
     working on my most high value task, determined from the night before.
  4. I work in 25 minute intervals, and then I take 5 minute breaks during
     which I do some light exercise and look at any notifications such as texts
or Twitter etc.
  5. At exactly my pre-planned time window (around 1:30 - 1:45) I begin getting
     ready for my day job which involves the same habitual tasks of putting
dinner in my bag, brewing up some coffee or tea depending on my mood, and
brushing my teeth.
  6. When I get home at night, I clean out my coffee cup, refill my water, get
     the coffee machine ready, and sit down to plan out my most high value task
for the next day.
  7. Finally, I relax by reading Reddit, a book, or watching a short Youtube
     video.
  8. I set my timer for exactly 5 hours, and I am asleep by no later than 12am.

> Now some of these things may seem a bit excessive or anal to you, however keep
> in mind I am currently in a highly devoted crunch mode for a couple of months. I've given up 95% of my
> "free" time to do nothing but study and learn web development. A small short
> term price to
> pay for rapidly accelerating my future career, rather than spending years.

### In conclusion...but not really
As long as this article ended up being, it really only scratches the surface. I
am hoping I at least opened some doors of thought for you, so that you have room
to explore the subject further. Definitely let me know if you have questions as
I'd love to hear feedback and suggest help for your particular situation!
