title: The Meteor Developer's Mega Learning Resource List

tags: Learning, Resources, Meteor, Javascript
---

I have previously made a mega resource for learning Rails, but since then I have switched focus to pure Front End / Meteor development, and so I thought it was time to create a mega resource for the Meteor community! I'll be updating this frequently, so suggestions are welcome. READMORE

> Before you read any further, I'm going to just throw this out there...simply reading the docs for all of the various languages, frameworks, and packages that you are working with will be just about as helpful as anything else. Simple, but effective. Any time you are coding, whether it's Meteor, pure Javascript, or HTML/CSS just open up the docs and have it ready as a reference. Okay, enough from me. Happy learning!

### Community Chats and Forums
Learning alone can be hard! Join in with others and get help when you really need it. This is my **#1** recommendation for anyone learning to code.

  * [Meteor Club Chat][] (Paid) - Join Josh Owens, several authors, MDG members, and more in an amazing and productive chat about all things Meteor.

  * [Free Code Camp Chat][] - Amazing community for Javascript learning (they mostly focus on the MEAN stack, but many also use Meteor)
  * [Codenewbie][] - Very active and enthusiastic community with chats, blog, forum and a weekly podcast.
