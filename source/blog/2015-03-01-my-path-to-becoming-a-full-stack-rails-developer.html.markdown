title: My Path to Becoming a Full Stack Rails Developer

Within this post I will be giving a chronological account of the articles,
  videos, books, and projects that I used on my path to learning Web Development
as well as any other major stepping stones along the way. READMORE

The way this will be structured is I will section off each month, which will
contain the various links to the material that I covered, as well as my personal
review of what I felt worked out, what I would do differently, etc.

In addition to the summaries here, I write a more detailed (and more
disorganized) breakdown every couple of days on my [ Dev Diary - "My Journey"
](http://colbycheeze.blogspot.com/)

### Febuary 2015
This month was another big change. I was developing on Linux with my PC, but I
was able to find someone to buy my entire gaming PC and all of my Youtube
equipment for 1600 bucks. I invested the other 400 into buying the new Macbook
Pro. I lost about a week of time in shipping and getting set up, but I also
switched from Sublime Text over to pure Tmux and Vim (SO GLAD)

With that out of the way, I moved over into focusing on front end development. I completed the
majority of the HTML5/CSS3 section on The Odin Project, and a decent portion of
the Javascript track.

I joined Upcase this month, as I felt that I was lacking in knowledge with
several things, such as overall design and Sass. I definitely don't want to
focus on being a designer or front end dev, but it is nice to be able to at
least function in that environment, so that is where most of my focus went while
building up my personal site (which you are now on).

I was a bit worried about spending so much time learning design, however I am
happy I took the time. Even though it won't be my focus going forward, I now
have the base to get any basic stuff done and I am looking at webpages
differently. I actually think about every element, how it appears, and what
method it was built with behind the scenes.

I did my first talk at a local Ruby Meetup about "Level up your workflow with
Vim and Tmux." It went really well and everyone seemed to enjoy it quite a bit.
I look forward to doing more live talks in the future, and was asked to give a
talk by one of the bigger meetup organizers.

I didn't spend as much time reading books, and instead watched more videos and
focused on actually doing work. My list of books to read keeps growing however,
and so I'll probably devote more time to it going forward.

### January 2015
I hit a lot of road blocks this month. I got sick which knocked out about a week
of learning. In addition to that, I began to build up a massive list of
resources and my focus began to drop quite a lot.

One of the big hurdles and reasons I fell behind is that I bit off a HUGE chunk
when I started the ["final
project"](http://www.theodinproject.com/ruby-on-rails/final-project) for
[TOP](http://www.theodinproject.com) Rails section. I tried to cram in learning RSpec testing,
Foundation CSS framework, and Devise Omniauth. I ran into a lot of road blocks
that took several hours for a single feature or line of code.

Overall I got a lot of the harder backend stuff, and some Ajax completed, but
decided to put off polishing up the project until I learned more about how to do
the front end side of things.

Towards the end of the month, I was able to put together a great productivity
system using [Kanbanflow](http://kanbanflow.com), and a slight mix of the GTD
system from [The Secret Weapon](http://www.thesecretweapon.org).

### December 2014
This month is where I really hit my biggest win, which was
discovering The Odin Project curriculum. Prior to this, I had NO idea where to
go with my learning, and was discouraged at my lack of money to put towards
joining a boot camp.

My learning history for this month wasn't kept perfectly, but I do have a Trello
board that I began around this time. I spent the last two weeks of the month focused
primarily on The Odin Project's Web Dev 101, Ruby, and Rails sections. [Check
out
the Trello board progress](https://trello.com/b/i5L13ALl/learn-programming) for
a nice breakdown of tasks I completed.

I began the ["My Journey" dev
blog](http://colbycheeze.blogspot.com/2014/12/motivated-yes-scattered-and-inefficient.html) towards the end of November. It took a bit for me to choose a technology and set of resources to focus on, but I got rolling about a week into December.

### November 2014
I just got my interested peaked in programming again, after wanting to help my
sister with her programming homework. I decided to do all of her homework
assignments along with her, as well as read a couple of Java books.

I also got introduced to Python this month, and played around with building some
simple game stuff in it.
